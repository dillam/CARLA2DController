# CARLA2DController
2D autonomous vehicle controller that navigates a racetrack using preset waypoints while maintaining desired speed in the CARLA simulator. A video of the controller can be found at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB24rA7mKSE). 

This controller uses longitudinal speed control with PID and Pure Pursuit lateral control.
